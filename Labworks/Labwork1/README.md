# Labwork 1: algorithms in Python

The aim of this practical session is to study simple algorithms on arrays. 

You will work on :
- searching for an element, with or without repetition ;
- various operations on an array ;
- finding an element (without repetition) in a sorted array ; 
- sorting an array, with different sort variants.

## TODO:
You have to fill the exercise located into the `students` folder.

Do not modify the others files located into the `tests` directory. 

To check if your work is functional, then use the following command:
```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

To check a single exercise, you may call the following (assuming exercise number `N`):
```bash
python -m unittest students/exerciseN.py
```
