# Exercise 6: sort an array with "insertion"
# - inputs: your function receives an array;
# - objective: return the array containing the same values as the input, but sorted.
#
# Insertion algorithm worked as follows:
# - writes a method to "insert" a value into the sorted result
# - starts with an empty result
# - for each value of the input: insert it into the result
# - returns the result
#
# NB: you can use the append method of an array (`array.append(42)`)
